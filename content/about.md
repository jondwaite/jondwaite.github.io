Hi, I'm Jon and have been working in IT for over 3 decades - I grew up in London and started my working life in the United Kingdom, In 2002 we emigrated, and since then have been living and working in the beautiful South Island of New Zealand.

My passion regarding computers started at a young age when I successfully managed (after months of annoying my parents) to get my first computer for a birthday which had a massive 1K (yes, 1 Kilobyte - or 1024 Bytes) of RAM on which I taught myself first BASIC and later Z80 Assembly Language.

I work extensively with virtualisation and container technologies including VMware, Microsoft, Red Hat, Kubernetes, etc. and love to learn and explore new things. In 2015 I was first awarded VMware vExpert status which I've now maintained for 10 years.

As you can probably tell from the content in this blog, I try to 'automate all the things' as much as possible to make managing complex environments easier, more predictable and less dreary - I know from feedback that at least some of my scripts and code have saved some people significant amounts of work which is what motivates me to keep writing & posting.

Why 'kiwicloud.ninja' - well **kiwi** is slang for New Zealanders, **cloud** should be self-explanatory from the nature of things I blog about, and **.ninja** as I discovered it was a real internet TLD and thought it looked fun.

Jon
