In the 5th part in this series of posts on vCloud Availability 3.0 I wanted to try something new, so I've made a short (~10 min) video showing the configuration of VM replication between an on-premise vSphere environment and a Cloud Provider service using the vSphere client plugin and the vCloud Director tenant portal.

This is a bit of an experiment for me as an alternative to long pages of screen grabs so I'd love to know what you think and if I should do more in this format. The video was captured/uploaded at 1080p so probably best viewed in that quality to be able to read details properly.<figure class="wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

I'm working on some followup videos showing how VM failover and failback works, and how to protect/migrate VMs between 2 Cloud Provider platforms - let me know what else you'd like to see too.

Jon.
