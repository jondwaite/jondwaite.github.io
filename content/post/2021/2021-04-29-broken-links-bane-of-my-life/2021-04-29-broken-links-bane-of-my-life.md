Just a quick note, a work colleague pointed out that some image links were broken in an old post on here from 2018. It looks like the last time I moved hosting providers something got confused within WordPress and a heap of image links got broken. I've run a search & replace across the database and hopefully found and fixed all (322!) links that were broken, but if you notice any that are still broken would be grateful if you could let me know. For some reason a 404 Not Found page confuses my current 'bad link checker' addon into thinking the links are actually ok&#8230; so I probably need to find a better one of them too&#8230;

Jon.
