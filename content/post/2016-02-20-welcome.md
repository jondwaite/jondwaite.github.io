I&#8217;ve been meaning to write a public blog for a while (ok, several years) now, but there always seemed to be something more important/urgent/fun to do so I never got around to it.

Having found out recently that my VMware vExpert status has been renewed for 2016 (Huge thanks guys!) I figured there really was no excuse not to and finally got off my behind to start up this site. I&#8217;m hoping to regularly update with code snippets and ramblings which I&#8217;m hoping other IT professionals will find useful &#8211; especially if working with VMware products in the service provider industry.

So why &#8216;kiwicloud.ninja&#8217; ? Well, I work in the Cloud / Service Provider industry in New Zealand (so kiwicloud), and only found that the .ninja TLD was available when hunting around to register a DNS name for the site and thought it looked like fun &#8211; nothing more than that!

As always, the views and opinions expressed on this site reflect my own and not those of my employer (no, I&#8217;m not going to mention them here, but anyone who wants to will find them anyway).

Regards, Jon.
